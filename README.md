# 🎓 College Database System – DBMS Project

This project demonstrates a relational database system designed for managing college-related data using SQL. It includes schema definitions, sample data, views, and queries, and is intended to showcase database management and SQL querying skills.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `ddl.sql` – Defines tables (e.g., students, addresses, extracurricular activities)
- `insert_data.sql` – Inserts sample data for testing
- `views.sql` – Creates a dynamic view and a materialized view
- `queries.sql` – Additional queries demonstrating data retrieval and aggregation

## 💡 Features

- Relational schema with normalized structure
- Dynamic view to filter addresses by city
- Materialized view to show teams with more than 5 participants
- SQL queries with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Create the database in your preferred RDBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)
2. Run `ddl.sql` to create the schema
3. Run `insert_data.sql` to populate tables
4. Run `views.sql` to create the views
5. Use `queries.sql` to run sample queries

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQL (ANSI-compliant)
